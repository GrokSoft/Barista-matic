#Barista-Matic

## A Coffee make simulator developed with AngularJS and Bootstrap 3

This is a coffee maker simulator I did as a programming exercise. I was given the following spec and about 6 hours to complete it.
The spec is written for a back-end only. **_I was told to ignore the backend and create a GUI instead. Since the position I was applying for is a front-end position._**

Developed with Angular & Bootstrap
